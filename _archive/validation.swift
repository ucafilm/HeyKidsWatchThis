print("🔧 Validation of SwiftUI State Management Fixes")
print("="*50)

print("\n✅ Key Issues Fixed:")
print("1. Removed force unwrapping (!) operators that caused crashes")
print("2. Fixed state modification during view updates")
print("3. Initialized all services in init() instead of lazy loading")
print("4. Added proper two-way binding between TabView and NavigationManager")

print("\n🔄 State Management Pattern:")
print("- Services initialized once in MainAppView.init()")
print("- Same service instances passed to all tabs via .environment()")
print("- NavigationManager uses the same shared services")
print("- No force unwrapping or optional chaining")

print("\n🎯 Expected Behavior:")
print("- App should launch without crashes")
print("- Watchlist should show movies added from Movies tab")
print("- Browse Movies button should switch to Movies tab")
print("- Debug tools available in Watchlist toolbar")

print("\n🛠️ Changes Made:")
print("MainAppView:")
print("  - Added init() to create shared service instances")
print("  - Removed lazy loading with force unwrapping")
print("  - Added two-way binding between selectedTab and navigationManager")

print("\nWatchlistView:")
print("  - Added DispatchQueue.main.async to debug button")
print("  - Simplified debug logic to avoid state access issues")

print("\n🧪 Testing Steps:")
print("1. Build and run the app")
print("2. Navigate to Movies tab")
print("3. Tap heart button on some movies to add to watchlist")
print("4. Switch to Watchlist tab")
print("5. Verify movies appear in watchlist")
print("6. Test Browse Movies button navigation")
print("7. Use Debug button if issues persist")

print("\n✅ Fixes are ready for testing!")
