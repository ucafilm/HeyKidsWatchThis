// CRITICAL FIX: App Termination Due to Missing Calendar Permissions
// 
// PROBLEM: App being terminated by iOS for accessing Calendar without proper Info.plist declarations
// SOLUTION: Created complete Info.plist with required calendar permission keys
//
// NEXT STEPS FOR YOU:
// 1. Open project in Xcode
// 2. Set GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO in Build Settings
// 3. Set INFOPLIST_FILE = HeyKidsWatchThis/Info.plist in Build Settings
// 4. Clean build and test
//
// The Info.plist file has been created at:
// T:\AI\Hey Kids Watch This\Real\HeyKidsWatchThis\HeyKidsWatchThis\Info.plist
//
// It includes these critical keys:
// - NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription
// - NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription
//
// This should stop the app termination and allow proper calendar permission prompts.

import Foundation

// Verification that Info.plist exists and contains required keys
struct CalendarPermissionsFix {
    static let infoPlistPath = "HeyKidsWatchThis/Info.plist"
    static let requiredKeys = [
        "NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription",
        "NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription"
    ]
    
    static let permissionDescriptions = [
        "NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription": "HeyKidsWatchThis needs calendar access to create movie night reminders and help you organize family time.",
        "NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription": "HeyKidsWatchThis needs calendar access to schedule your family movie nights."
    ]
    
    // This fix addresses the root cause of app termination:
    // iOS kills apps that access protected resources without proper privacy declarations
}

/*
XCODE PROJECT SETTINGS TO UPDATE:

Build Settings to Change:
1. GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO (currently YES)
2. INFOPLIST_FILE = HeyKidsWatchThis/Info.plist (currently not set)

OR manually add to Info tab:
- NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription
- NSCalendarsWriteOnlyAccessUsageDescription

This will stop the immediate app termination and enable proper calendar functionality.
